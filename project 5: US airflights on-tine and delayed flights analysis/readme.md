# (US air force on-time and delayed flights analysis)
## by (Mahmoud Samneh)


## Dataset

> Through this project our main goal to do root cause analyses for the delayed flights and to see their effect on the movement of flights from 2017 till 2020


## Summary of Findings

>our project consisted of case studies as follows 

>Case study 1: what is the portion of canceled and diverted of top ten airports?
>By answering this question we will demonstrate the percentage of cancelled and diverted flights the percentages yields the performance of the airport in general and it shows how each airport stand to each other

>From bar chart we found the airports that has the highest not arrival flights which will make the passengers think twice when they see these names once they book there flights , a bad trend for revenue which needs to do gap analysis

>Case study 2: Through 2017 till 2020 are delayed flights increase or decrease?
>we can see from the scatter chart that number of flights through all the airports is being reduced which is a good indicator

>Case study 3: For each airport what is the delaying factor for the flights?

Through pie chart we found that late aircraft and carrier are the most affective factors for delaying the flights we need to dig deep to reduce this delay

>Case study 4: For the airports with the highest value of delayed flights what is the cause that contributed the most?

>From the stacked bar chart analysis we found out the carrier was the delaying factor for most of the flights


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the last bar chart which is related to case study 4 we did the following polishing 
 >transferring the y_data into log data
 >make the bars stacked
